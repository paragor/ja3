# JA3 - High Performance Go Implementation [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/open-ch/ja3?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/open-ch/ja3) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/open-ch/ja3)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/open-ch/ja3)

"JA3 is a method for creating SSL/TLS client fingerprints that should be easy to produce on any platform and can be easily shared for threat intelligence." - John B. Althouse

The algorithm originates from Salesforce and the official Python and Bro implementations can be found [here](https://github.com/salesforce/ja3). For information about what JA3 is and how it works check out their repository or their blog [post](https://engineering.salesforce.com/open-sourcing-ja3-92c9e53c3c41).

This package includes a go library with an implementation of the algorithm and a command line tool which allows reading packets from pcap and pcapng files as well as from an interface.

Our requirements on the Go Implementation of the JA3 library were efficiency, robustness and correctness. Unfortunately no public available implementation did fulfill all these requirements.

## Usage

```
import "github.com/open-ch/ja3"
```
See the following example to get an idea of the exposed API. For more information consult the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/open-ch/ja3).

```
j, err := ja3.ComputeJA3FromSegment(tcpPayload)
if err != nil {
    // If the packet is no Client Hello an error is thrown as soon as the parsing fails
    panic(err)
}

// Get the JA3 digest, string and SNI of the parsed Client Hello
ja3Hash := j.GetJA3Hash()
ja3String := j.GetJA3String()
sni := j.GetSNI()
fmt.Printf("JA3Hash: %v, JA3String: %v, SNI: %v\n", ja3Hash, ja3String, sni)

// Get the JA3 string as a byte array for more efficient handling
ja3String := j.GetJA3ByteString()
anyWriterClass.Write(ja3String)
```

To check out the CLI, try the following on your preferred shell.
```
[host:]# go build ja3exporter.go engine.go

[host:]# ./ja3exporter -pcap="/path/to/file"
{"destination_ip":"172.217.168.67","destination_port":443,"ja3":"771,49200-49196-49199-49195-49172-49162-49171-49161-159-158-57-51-157-156-53-47-10-255,0-11-10-35-13-5-15-13172,23-25-28-27-24-26-22-14-13-11-12-9-10,0-1-2","ja3_digest":"5e647d60a56d199388ae462b75b3cdad","source_ip":"213.156.236.180","source_port":34577,"sni":"www.google.ch","timestamp":1537516825571014000}
```

**Attention: By default, the JA3Exporter only supports packets built up of an Ethernet - IPv4 or IPv6 - TCP Stack.**

If the package structure does not comply with this, use the -c flag for compatibility mode. Beware that this will make the JA3Exporter significantly slower.

## Tests and Benchmarks
As the TLS parser is custom built and highly optimized for the JA3 digest, a full coverage testing suite is put in place.
Our Go implementation is more than an order of magnitude faster than the python implementation.
